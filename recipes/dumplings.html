   <h3>Description</h3>

   <p>This recipe is made with just six ingredients you probably already have on hand:</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li><b>Flour:</b> These dumplings start with all-purpose flour, which creates structure and holds the other ingredients together.</li>
    <li><b>Baking powder:</b> Baking powder is a leavening agent, which means it releases gas that makes the dough expand. It's responsible for the dumplings' light and fluffy texture.</li>
    <li><b>White sugar</b>:</b> A teaspoon of sugar adds an extremely subtle hint of sweetness. It also helps the dumplings retain their moisture through the cooking process and slows gluten development, which ensures tender dumplings.</li>
    <li><b>Salt:</b> A pinch of salt seasons the dumplings and enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
    <li><b>Butter or margarine:</b> Cold butter or margarine is cut into the flour mixture to bind the dry ingredients together. It also keeps the dumplings light and tender.</li>
    <li><b>Milk: </b>Whole milk helps create a smooth, moist dough.</li>
    </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Stir together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Stir in milk and mix until a batter forms that is thick enough to be scooped with a spoon. Allow batter to rest for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Drop batter by spoonfuls into boiling stew or soup. Cover and simmer without lifting the lid for 15 minutes. Serve.</li>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
   </ol>
